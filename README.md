# Arizona-WRF
This repository contains the scripts that are used in EAGER project, especially the GPS-PWV assimilation work. 
The scripts are written in pyhton (.ipynb), Matlab, NCL, and c-shell. They are written mostly by C. Bayu Risanto, S.J. Some are modified from earlier scripts written by his colleagues James M. Moker, Jr. and Avelino F. Arellano, Jr.  
We also include the namelist.input and namelist.var that were used to run the WRF 4.2.1 and DART in our simulations.
