# Arizona-WRF
This repository contains the scripts that are used in EAGER project, especially the GPS-PWV assimilation work. 
The scripts are written in pyhton (.ipynb), Matlab, NCL, and c-shell. They are written mostly by C. Bayu Risanto, S.J. Some are modified from earlier scripts written by his colleagues Dr. James M Moker and Dr. Avelino Arellano.  
We also include the namelist.input and namelist.var that were used to run the WRF 4.2.1 and DART in our simulations.
